Changing careers is no easy task.

Over the past year, I’ve been gradually building the skills needed to transition from the only career I’ve ever known to becoming a front-end dev.    Prior to beginning this self-taught development journey, I had no technical background — unless a basic working knowledge of Excel counts!

As a full-time working mom, I need to be strategic about how I spend my time.  To make sure I was learning the right things and building the right stuff, I went to developers at all levels - from junior to VP - and asked the same question: <em>As someone coming from a non-technical role - how can I make myself stand out?</em>

<strong>(1) Yes, you <em>should</em> build a portfolio</strong>

Especially consider putting together a portfolio if you’re coming in at an entry level.  Don’t worry - you don’t need to spend months building a portfolio from scratch.  Host one easily using Github Pages or a website-generation site like Wix or Squarespace.  That part’s not important.

What IS important is being strategic about the <em>types</em> of projects you put in your portfolio.  Remember that recruiters and hiring managers are looking through a lot of other portfolios like yours.  Make it stand out by making it clear which languages/frameworks you used so that they can see how your skills match the role you’re looking for.

Don’t put every single project you’ve ever done in your portfolio.  There is no way a recruiter is going to look through 25 projects from every single candidate that crosses their path.  Narrow it down to 2-4 that really show the breadth and depth of your skills.

<strong>(2) Build a network</strong>

Being an employee referral increases your chances of getting the job by 10x.  That’s not all — building a network will help you to stay on top of new things going in the tech industry, meet potential mentors/mentees, enhance the skills that you need to level up your career, and keep you motivated during those tough times.  For the introverts out there, I know that networking can be super awkward and stressful.  With practice, it will just get easier so take comfort in knowing that today - Day 1 - is going to be the most awkward and then you’ll only go up from here.

So how can you network?  If already working for a company, you may already have an engineering team or business applications group that you can meet with and ask for help.  Starting out, reach out to members of engineering with a quick note asking them to have coffee or lunch.  “Hey, we don’t know each other but I was wondering if you’d be open to having coffee with me next week?  I’m learning JavaScript and I’d love to hear more about your journey in tech and ask you questions about whether I’m on the right track.”

During your coffee meeting, one thing that you can ask is how else to get connected to more developers.  They may be able to recommend you to developer communities or slack channels that may not have already been on your radar.

If you aren’t working for a company with a lot of developers, you can meet other developers in the area by attending meetups in your area or by volunteering for local groups focused on tech.  If you live in a really remote area where there aren’t many meetups in the field of tech you want to get into, build a network remotely using Twitter and Dev.to.  Post and use hashtags, and reply to posts from others.

<strong>(3) Toot your own horn!</strong>

It’s YOUR JOB to make sure you’re putting your work in front of who it needs to get in front of.  Talk about what you’re working on and show off your progress.  It’s a tough shift to make for people who - like me - were taught that tooting your own horn makes you obnoxious.  Here are some ways to put yourself out there without feeling bad about it:
     
* Solve a problem/complete a project, then write a blog post about how you did it.  Share the blog post with an engineering manager and ask for feedback
* Commit to writing social media posts 3x week about the progress on your current project
* While you are doing the networking you committed to in #1, talk about what you are working on and your career plans.  Don’t forget to reciprocate by asking the person sitting across from you about the exciting projects they are a part of as well.
* Take credit for the work you’ve done
* Accept compliments by simply saying “thank you”

<strong>(4) If you want to be a good frontend developer, you need to learn at least a little about a backend framework</strong>

Or vice versa.  While you’re at it, learn a little bit about design, too - especially if you want to freelance, work for a large company, or eventually move into management.  Your work as a dev will require you to understand requirements from someone who essentially is speaking a different language than you, then pass off your work to someone who uses <em>another</em> language!

Coming from the software sales world, I see how often devs get stuck in their own bubble and forget to get a wholistic understanding of their product from the customer side, sales side, or even the design side.  You can make yourself stand out by understanding at least a little about what is going on over the fence and how the work you do will make an impact, or what you could do to make their jobs/lives easier.  Take a course in something new or talk with someone else who is in the role.

<strong>Several lines readable of code > one line of code that only you understand</strong>

This goes along with the last piece of advice.  Even if you don’t expect to be working on a team, remember that one day, you’ll need to read your own code again after not-having looked at it for several months.  Do your future self/future colleagues a favor and name your functions something like <em>formatPhoneNumber</em> instead of <em>fixFon</em>.
