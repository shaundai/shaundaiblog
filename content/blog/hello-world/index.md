Hi there,

I'm Shaundai (pronounced like a day of the week: "Saturday, Sunday, Shaundai").

By trade, I'm actually in tech sales.  I started my journey in tech sales in 2011 selling MATLAB and Simulink to engineers and developers.

These days, I sell to salespeople.  On the side and in every bit of my spare time, I love coding.  Very soon, I'd like to move to a UI engineering role and build the technology that I love so much.

Follow me to watch my journey, get inspired, or to cheer me on!

The most important and exciting part of my life is my 2-year-old son.  You can hear about our adventures on Twitter.

```js
function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello World!")
}
```
