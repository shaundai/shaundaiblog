Hi there,

I'm Shaundai (pronounced like a day of the week: "Saturday, Sunday, Shaundai").

By trade, I'm in technology sales.  I started my journey in tech sales in 2011 selling MATLAB and Simulink to engineers and developers.  These days, I sell to salespeople.  

By passion, I'm a front-end developer.  Very soon, I'd like to move to a full-time UI Engineering role and take part in building the technology I love so much.

Follow me to watch my journey, get inspired, or to cheer me on as I make a career switch!

The most important and exciting part of my life is my 2-year-old son.  You can hear about our adventures on Twitter.

```js
function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello World!")
}
