#### **What is TypeScript?**

TypeScript is a programming language developed and released by Microsoft in 2012.

TypeScript is just a superset of JavaScript, meaning that you can use TypeScript to do everything you’re used to doing in JavaScript *and more*.  Microsoft aimed to fill in certain gaps JavaScript leaves in enterprise-level applications (we’ll talk about these differences in just a bit) and TypeScript is meant to close those gaps.

When you run an application built in TypeScript in a local or production environment, the code is compiled into JavaScript.  For this reason, you can use TypeScript anywhere you’d normally use JavaScript – the frontend or the backend!  Replacing JavaScript code with TypeScript is easy to do

##### Kinda like PropTypes.  But better.

So… why not just use JavaScript?  The short answer - TypeScript makes code **less error prone** and **more readable**.  TypeScript is also better for projects that fit any of the following criteria:

    * Are large or complex
    * Need to be maintained by multiple people
    * Will evolve and be maintained over time

###### Cons:

Some might argue that TypeScript is more trouble than it’s worth because it takes longer to develop.  Essentially, you’re adding static types to a dynamically-written language so 


#### The Basics

Start your file - needs to be .ts (or .tsx if you're testing)

Implied Types vs Explicit Types

Types are optional, but it's the part of TypeScript that makes it what it is.  If you don't include a type, TypeScript will infer

Data Types (w/examples)
Number
String
Objects
Boolean
Array
Any
