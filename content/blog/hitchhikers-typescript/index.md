#### **What is TypeScript?**
TypeScript is a programming language developed and released by Microsoft in 2012.

TypeScript is just a superset of JavaScript, meaning that you can use TypeScript to do everything you’re used to doing in JavaScript and more.  Microsoft aimed to fill in certain gaps JavaScript leaves in enterprise-level applications (we’ll talk about these differences in just a bit) and TypeScript is meant to close those gaps.

When you run an application built in TypeScript in a local or production environment, the code is compiled into JavaScript.  For this reason, you can use TypeScript anywhere you’d normally use JavaScript – the frontend or the backend!  Replacing JavaScript code with TypeScript is easy to do

Kinda like PropTypes.  But better.
So… why not just use JavaScript?  TypeScript is better for projects that are:
•	Large or complex
•	Need to be maintained by multiple people
•	Will evolve and grow over time
