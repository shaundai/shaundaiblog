In July 2019, I’d committed to *really* learning JavaScript with the intention of eventually building enough skills to make a career switch.  A little over a year later, I accepted an offer as a Junior UI Engineer at my [current company](https://www.salesloft.com).  When I first started at SalesLoft, I had 11 successful years of experience in sales and 0 years of professional experience as a developer.  I wasn't sure that making a career switch to engineering was possible or even was something that I wanted to do.
However, 

SalesLoft is a software company based out of Atlanta, GA.  Some things that made my current company a good fit for my first software engineering job:

If you’re looking to make a switch to a more technical role but don’t want to leave your current company (I assume that’s why you’re here in the first place!), here’s some practical advice based on things I’ve done to stand out.


Here are some reasons you might be looking to stay with your current company:

-  You love the company you're with

-  The tech stack matches your areas of interest

-  You want to explore something new


#### Find a Mentor

A mentor:
- Does not have to work at your company
- Is 1-3 levels above where you are in your career
- Works with you formally or informally on your career objectives
- Can work with you to discuss challenges in your code and help you get unstuck when you hit a problem
- Follows your lead.  You drive the relationship - deciding what to meet about, bringing forward questions that you have, facilitating times to meet, etc.


#### Find an Internal Advocate
This person is likely a different person from your mentor, but it could be the same person.  An internal advocate will go to bat for you when you're not around.  The internal advocate will get in front of the right people (and make sure that YOU'RE put in front of the right people) with the message that you rock and you would make a strong fit on your company's engineering team.  Here are some qualities of a good advocate:
- Works for your company at a senior leadership or higher
- Provides you with helpful information about how to stand out at your organization
- Is trusted and respected by the people who make the hiring decisions on your engineering team
- If put in front of one of the people who make the hiring decision on your engineering team, is willing to speak on behalf of you
- Speaks highly of you (and often) when you're not around

How to get an Internal Advocate
- Give him/her talking points! Make a point to regularly reach out to show them projects you're working on and ask for their feedback.  Ask: "If I were building this for {{our company}}, what would I add?" "If I were working on this project with others, what kinds of things should I incorporate?" "Is this something you'd find useful? What would you change?"


#### Go for coffee
Invite someone from your engineering team out for coffee once a week.  I mean, it doesn't have to be coffee.  Could be tea.  Could be for a walk and talk over the phone.  This rule is true for everything - it's not always what you know - it's WHO you know.  When it comes down to you vs another internal candidate, if more people on your engineering team already know you and start to see you as a natural fit for the team, they are going to advocate for YOU to be the next engineering hire.

#### Toot your own horn
Self-advocacy makes a lot of us feel uncomfortable.  It can feel like bragging or showing off.  But if you're not letting people know about what you're working on, no one will know about all of the time and effort you've been putting into learning to code.  And I can guarantee that if there IS someone else who feels comfortable talking about their work, they are going to get that job when it opens up before you do.

###### Here are some ways to toot your own horn (without feeling too braggy):
Set up quarterly meetings with the hiring manager to talk through progress.  I used this spreadsheet in one of my conversations to highlight the projects that I'd done and how they mapped to the skills on the junior job listing.

Show your hiring manager your plan – ask for feedback

#### Get buy-in from your current manager
Chances are that if you are happy enough at your own company that you want to just make a shift to a diff department vs going somewhere else, you have a manager who would be open to seeing you grow.  You may be surprised – sometimes you just need to ask.

Figure out which projects would be appealing to your team and BUILD THEM

Do a Good Job!
