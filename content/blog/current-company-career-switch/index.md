Last month (Sept 2020), I accepted an offer as a Junior Software Engineer at my current company, SalesLoft.  In July 2019, I’d committed to *really* learning JavaScript with the intention of eventually building enough skills to make a career switch.  At the time, I had no plans to leave the company, and what made my switch

SalesLoft is a software company based out of Atlanta, GA.  Some things that made my current company a good fit for my first software engineering job:

•	I already knew and loved the company
•	The tech stack matched my areas of interest (React, Node)
•	I was a user of our software, so I was able to look at development from a different lens

If you’re looking to make a switch to a more technical role but don’t want to leave your current company (I assume that’s why you’re here in the first place!), here’s some practical advice based on things I’ve done to stand out.


Here are some reasons you might be looking to stay with your current company:


Find a Mentor

A mentor:
-Does not have to work at your company

Find an Internal Advocate
This may be different than a mentor.  Or it could be the same person.  An internal advocate will go to bat for you when you're not around.  The internal advocate will get in front of the right people (and make sure that YOU'RE put in front of the right people) with the message that you rock and you would make a strong fit on your company's engineering team.  Here are some qualities of a good internal candidate:
-Provides you with helpful information about how to stand out at your organization
-Is trusted and respected by the people who make the hiring decisions on your engineering team
-Works for your company
-If put in front of one of the people who make the hiring decision on your engineering team, is willing to speak on behalf of you
-Speaks highly of you (and often) when you're not around

How to get an Internal Advocate
-Give him/her talking points! Make a point to regularly reach out to show them projects you're working on and ask for their feedback.  Ask: "If I were building this for {{our company}}, what would I add?" "If I were working on this project with others, what kinds of things should I incorporate?" "Is this something you'd find useful? What would you change?"


Invite someone from your engineering team out for coffee once a week

Toot your own horn

Show your hiring manager your plan – ask for feedback

Get buy-in from your current manager
Chances are that if you are happy enough at your own company that you want to just make a shift to a diff department vs going somewhere else, you have a manager who would be open to seeing you grow.  You may be surprised – sometimes you just need to ask.

Figure out which projects would be appealing to your team and BUILD THEM

Learn about your company’s tech stack
